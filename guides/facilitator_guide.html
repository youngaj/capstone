            Welcome Boys and Girls Club facilitators to the <span class="powerU_bold">PowerU Tech Mission Guide</span>
            Powered by Learning Blade!
          </p>
          <p>This is the second part of the modular experience that will help students to immerse into the world of STEM
            and to
            create clear pathways into STEM careers!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few instructions and hints for you as facilitators of this experience.
          </p>
          <div class="powerU_subheading">SUMMARY</div>
          <p>
            After the STEM-based Escape Room, students will participate in a web-based assignment that aligns with STEM
            careers of today. To enable this opportunity, you will leverage a website called Learning Blade to manage
            students (as needed) and quickly determine the winner of the game. The total duration of this experience is
            approximately 60 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have selected 3 missions of similar difficulty from the Learning Blade platform. These missions will
            expose the students to STEM skills and careers through solving real-world problems. Generic templates have
            been created and uploaded on your behalf; so you can concentrate on creating an exciting and engaging
            experience!
          </p>

          <div class="powerU_subheading">THE SETUP (10 min)</div>

            Have any of you heard or seen the movie Hidden Figures? Well in the Tech Escape you learned about Dr. Gladys
            West which is another one of America’s hidden figures.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was known for her contributions to the mathematical modeling of the shape of the Earth. Her work led to
            the invention of the Global Positioning System; which is also known as?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A: GPS</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also learned about Garrett Morgan, Mark Kean and Marie Van Brittan Brown. Can anyone share with us
            something they learned about those pioneers?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Marie Van Brittan Brown – invented the first video home security system in 1966. It consisted of
              peephole, a sliding
              camera, television monitors and two-way microphones. This created a system called closed circuit
              television system for
              surveillance.. also known as CCTV. Her invention paved the way for the technology we use today.
            </li>
            <li>
              Garrett Morgan – Notable inventions: sewing machine, traffic light, gas mask. The gas mask was
              instrumental in saving
              lives by protecting the wearer from smoke and ammonia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mark Kean/Dean – co- inventor of IBM’s original personal computer and the color PC monitor changing how we
              interact
              with the internet. This technology has allowed for the creation of keyboards, printers and all the things
              that connect
              to your computer…
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of these pioneers helped pave the way to what we call STEM today. So now we’re going to learn about
            some current-day STEM careers. As part of our next experience, Tech Missions we are going to play a game of
            solving some real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three missions, Hack Attack, Robot Rescue and Haiti Orphanage.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Hack Attack, your school’s website has been hacked!! You learn how to create and protect a website,
              apps and social media to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Robot Rescue, you will learn how to use sensors, circuits and computers to design robots
            </li>
            <li>
              In Mission Haiti Orphanage your help is needed to help design an environmentally-sound orphanage for those
              that were left homeless after an earthquake in Haiti.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Doesn’t that sound exciting? Are you ready for the challenge??

          </p>
          <p>
            Ok, so in just a minute, I am going to divide you into 2 (or 3 depending on class size) groups. Each
            group/class has been assigned a different mission in Learning Blade. You will work in teams of 2-4 to
            complete as many tasks as you can within the allotted time of 40 minutes.
          </p>
          <p class="powerU_centered_instructions">
            Divide class into 2 or 3 groups/classes<br>
            Divide group/class into teams of 2-4 student<br>
            Distribute login credentials (Appendix A)
          </p>
          <div class="powerU_subheading">HOW TO PLAY</div>
          <p>
            I have given you each a login. One person should accept the mission and log in to Learning Blade using that
            login. Once your team has logged in. Look for the "My Missions" button. When you select it you will see your
            assigned mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Select your assigned mission and view/complete the mission guide. Once your team has viewed the mission
            guide; raise your hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok, now that everyone has accepted their Tech Mission, we are READY TO PLAY!!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to set the timer for 40 minutes and when I say “GO” your team should complete as many of those
            tasks on the right as possible. Everyone on the team should take the lead on at least one task and you don't
            have to go in order!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we get started, are there any questions? READY, SET, GO!
          </p>

          <div class="powerU_subheading">GAME OUTRO: THE WRAP-UP (10 minutes)</div>
          <p>
            Alright, teams, time is up! Please take a break while we determine the winner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, so before we announce the winning class… let’s talk a little about the Missions.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What did you think of Mission Hack Attack?</li>
            <li>What were some of the careers you learned about in Hack Attack? What were some of the other careers
              explored?</li>
            <li>Can someone in Class RobotRescue tell us what they did in their mission and what they learned about?
              Anyone have</li>
            anything else they would like to add? What careers did you learn about in the Robot mission?
            <li>What were your thoughts on Mission Haiti Orphanage? <Repeat follow-up questions above>
            </li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            As you may have noticed, there are so many careers in STEM that make a positive impact in our world. And I
            hope you
            see that YOU have the power to create that impact!

          </p>
          <p>
            So now the moment we've been waiting for... the winner is (insert team name)!

          </p>
          <p>Congratulations, (insert names of winning team members). You did an outstanding job, and your hard work
            paid off. But
            let's not forget you are all winners in your pursuit to learn about STEM.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you all enjoyed today's activity and learned more about STEM careers. You can continue to explore
            these careers
            on your own by checking out the PowerU summary we are going to provide you. And remember, STEM is all around
            us, so
            keep exploring, learning, and asking questions.

            <li>The Tech Escape experience should take between 30 and 45 minutes to complete</li>
            <li>The Tech Mission should take approximately 40 minutes to complete. You must set a timer outside of Tech
              Mission Powered by Learning Blade at the beginning of the experience to count down 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally add the wrong mission or Tools and Teammates see Condensed Teach Guide - Step 5
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Here’s how the Leader Board works</li>
                <li>Log in with your teacher account</li>
                <li>Click on Dashboard on the top button menu</li>
                <li>
                  Under Leader board, select the appropriate class and mission. (You can only show a leader board for
                  a class, and the mission must be assigned to the class to select it.)
                </li>
                <li>The leader board will display a list of the mission scores for each student in the class.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Only the first response is included in the Student's score even though they will receive a second
              attempt at the questions.
            </li>
            <li>There are three Missions to choose from, which will be provided from the survey:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Hack Attack</li>
                <li>Robot Rescue</li>
                <li>Haiti Orphanage</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The team with the highest number of points wins.</li>
